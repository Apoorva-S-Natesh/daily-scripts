<!-- What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical scope defines the accessibility of variables and functions depending on their location in the source code. Variables and functions have different levels of scope:

Global Scope: Variables defined outside any function or block, accessible anywhere in the program.
Local Scope: Variables defined inside a function or block, accessible only within that specific function or block.
Nested Scope: Inner functions have access to variables in their parent functions.
Block Scope: Variables defined with let and const are limited to the block they are declared in, like loops or conditionals.

Each function creates its own environment(a branch). Variables and functions live on their respective branches. It something isn't found on the current branch, JS climbs up to the parent branch.
Child scope will have access to its parent scope properties because in every scope we have one reference variable which will be pointing towards its parent scope.
