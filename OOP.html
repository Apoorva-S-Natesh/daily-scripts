<!--

1. In global memory allocation, s1 will be allocated undefined.
2. The errors in class will be checked and scanned but class is not stored in the memory.
3. As soon as constructor is called an Object of the particular class in the memory. (Calling of constructor and Creation of object)
In memory we have two parts, Stack segment and heap segment, in stack - object name or reference variables will be stored, in heap - objects will occupy
4. When control comes inside the constructor, the stack frame of constructor is created.
this keyword is holding the address of the current object.
5. Inside object name, age, email will be initialized with the values sent.
6. control leaves the constructor and comes back to the statement where it was called and the return value is the momory address of object,
the globl variable will now have the address of the object and the stack frame of constructor is deleted.
