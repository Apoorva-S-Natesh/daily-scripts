    <h1>Variable Declaration</h1>

    <p>While declaring Variables in javascript we have to use 
        either of the keyword: var, let, const.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The variables which are declared using var can be accessed Inside the same
            block (scope) in which it is Declared as well as Outside the block as well.
        </li>

        <li>In short var declared variables does not have any block scope</li>
    </ul>

    <script> 
        var a = 10; //declaration and initialization of a
        console.log(a); // allowed
        {
            console.log('Accessing a inside block',a); //allowed
            var b = 300;
            console.log(b);
        }
        console.log('Accessing b Outside the block: ',b)//allowed
    </script>
